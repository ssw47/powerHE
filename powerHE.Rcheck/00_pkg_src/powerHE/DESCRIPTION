Description: Calculate sample size or power for hierarchical endpoints. 
  The package can handle any type of outcomes (binary, continuous, count, ordinal, 
  time-to-event) and any number of such endpoints. It allows users to calculate 
  sample size with a given power or to calculate power with a given sample size 
  for hypothesis testing based on win ratios, win odds, net benefit, or DOOR 
  (desirability of outcome ranking) as treatment effect between two groups for 
  hierarchical endpoints.
