Description: Calculate sample size or power for hierarchical endpoints. 
  The package can handle any type of outcomes (binary, continuous, count, ordinal, 
  time-to-event) and any number of such endpoints. It allows users to calculate 
  sample size with a given power or to calculate power with a given sample size 
  for hypothesis testing based on win ratios, win odds, net benefit, or DOOR 
  (desirability of outcome ranking) as treatment effect between two groups for 
  hierarchical endpoints. The methods of this package are described further in 
  the paper by Barnhart, H. X. et al. (2024, <doi:10.1080/19466315.2024.2365629>).
